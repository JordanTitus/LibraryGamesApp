Additional Notes:
Part 2 of this assignment was done in windows forms, but I failed tragically and thus moved back to WPF for the final version. 
The entire part 2 was made from the ground up and part one was changed minimally, just fixed some crashes.
Part 3 required the use of files and trees.
I used a text file to store the data for the tree.
Because of the way I coded, the 000 section could not be added (ints were used in the tree).
To compensate the other sections were made larger
